In MISRA C:2012 Guidelines for the use of the C language in critical systems ,there is a rule called "A cast shall not remove any const or volatile qualification from the type pointed to by a pointer".
Any attempt to remove the qualification associated with the addressed type by using casting is aviolation of the principle of type qualification.
If you attempt to remove const or volatile qualifiers from a type using a cast, it can lead to undefined behavior. Undefined behavior means that the behavior of your program is not defined by the language standard, and it can result in unpredictable and potentially incorrect program execution,which will cause the program to run incorrectly or even crash.

Some of the problems that might arise if a qualifier is removed from the addressed object are:
1.Removing a const qualifier might circumvent the read-only status of an object and result in itbeing modified;
2.Removing a const qualifier might result in an exception when the object is accessed;

## An undefined behavior issue caused by the misuse of volatile keyword was discovered in Amazon FreeRTOS in functon vTaskSetApplicationTaskTag() of /amazon-freertos/freertos_kernel/tasks.c file in line 2916.
3.Removing a volatile qualifier might result in accesses to the object being optimized away.
