In MISRA C:2012 Guidelines for the use of the C language in critical systems ,there is a rule called "A cast shall not remove any const or volatile qualifi cation from the typepointed to by a pointer"
Any attempt to remove the qualification associated with the addressed type by using casting is aviolation of the principle of type qualifi cation.Note: the qualifi cation referred to here is not the same as any qualifi cation that may be applied to thepointer itself.Some of the problems that might arise if a qualifi er is removed from the addressed object are:ï Removing a const qualifi er might circumvent the read-only status of an object and result in itbeing modifi ed;ï Removing a const qualifi er might result in an exception when the object is accessed;ï Removing a volatile qualifi er might result in accesses to the object being optimized away.Note: removal of the C99 restrict type qualifi er is benign.
